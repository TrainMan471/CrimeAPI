# CrimeAPI
This repo is for my project for the 2020 May JavaScript Code Louisville Session

To be able to run my project on your machine, you will need to:
1)git clone the repo onto your local machine
2)My project runs on an express server, so you will need node and express.
3)When the project is downloaded run "node server.js" to get the project running.
4)It should be running on port 2000, so "localhost: 2000" on your machine.


For this project, my goal is/was to make a very simple website that makes an API to the FBI's offical crime database and then display that data in an HTML file users can access.
So the requirements I chose were 
1)Retrieve data from an external API and display data in your app (such as with fetch() or with AJAX)
2)Calculate and display data based on an external factor (ex: get the current date, and display how many days remaining until some event)
