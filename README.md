This repo is for my project for the 2020 May JavaScript Code Louisville Session

To be able to run my project on your machine, you will need to:


1)git clone the repo onto your local machine

2)My project runs on an express server, so you will need node and express.

3)When the project is downloaded run "node server.js" to get the project running.

4)It should be running on port 2000, so "localhost: 2000" on your machine.
